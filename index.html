            <p> I'm living in the midwest with my family. We'll be leaving to go back home to Hawai'i in the next few years and we're very excited! When we move back to Hawai'i I plan to attend BYU-Hawai'i to complete my degree in Marine Biology. My long term goal is to become a Computation Biologist with a specialty in Marine Biology. The photo on the right was my daughter's first birthday. Since her birthday was in the middle of winter, we took her to the aquarium and she had a blast! I only have one child and a wonderful and loving husband. I am an avid plant parent with about 30 plants. I also enjoy quilting, knitting, and reading. My most recent project I'm working on is a quilt made of all of my favorite clothes from my daughter's first year. </p>
